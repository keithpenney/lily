GNU Lilypond music notation syntax and notes

General:
--------
  Case-sensitive
  Parser looks for whitespace-separation
  % single line comments
  %{ block (multi-line)comments %}
  All lilypond input files should have a \version statement

Version Statement:
------------------
  \version "2.20.0"

Basic Input:
------------
  Example:
  --------
    \version "2.20.0"
    {
      c' e' g' e'
    }

  Pitch:
  ------
    Note names are lowercase
    Octaves are specified with appended apostrophe's.
    E.g.
      c,,     % (C1) C three octaves below middle C
      c,      % (C2) C two octaves below middle C
      c       % (C3) C below middle C
      c'      % (C4) Middle C
      a'      % (A4) A above middle C
      d''     % (D5) D above C above middle C
      c'''    % (C6) C two octaves above middle C

    Note names are always absolute (i.e. are not relative to the key
    signature).

    Accidentals:
    ------------
      The syntactical elements for flat and sharp derive from Dutch/German. To
      indicate a flatted note, append an 'es'.  To indicate a sharped note,
      append an 'is'.

      E.g.
        aes   % Ab below middle C
        cis'' % C# above middle C
        feses'''8 % Fbb two octaves above middle C, eighth note duration

  Relative Input:
  ---------------
    The octave for each note is chosen to be relative to the note prior (w/in
    the same octave (+/- half-octave) using the 'relative' block.

    \relative { 
      c' d e f g a b c
    }

    The first note of the relative block determines the starting note of the
    melody.  From that point, all subsequent notes are placed relative to the
    note prior.  To raise a note by an octave relative to that which would have
    otherwise been assumed, append an apostrophe (or multiple).  To lower a 
    note by an octave, append a comma (or multiple).

    \relative {
      c'' d c' d, c d c' d,
    }
    
    In the above example, the melody starts on C above Middle C then goes up by
    a whole step, then up by a minor seventh, then down by a minor seventh, then
    repeats.

  Rhythm & Durations:
  -------------------
    The duration of a note is indicated by a number following the note name.
      Number  Note Duration
      ------  -------------
      1       Whole Note
      2       Half Note
      4       Quarter Note
      8       Eighth note
      16      Sixteenth Note
      32      Thirty-second Note

    If a note duration is not specified, the duration is taken from that of the
    previous note.

    Dotted Notes:
    -------------
      A dotted note is specified by an appended period '.' following the note
      name.  IMPORTANT! The note duration MUST be specified for a dotted note
      (i.e. the duration will not be assumed to be that of the prior note)

    Ties:
    -----
      Ties are indicated by appending a tilde to the note to start on which the
      tie starts - the tie automatically continues to the next note.  Ties can
      make use of the 'last explicit pitch' rule where we just have to indicate
      the duration of the next note and it takes its pitch from the last explicit
      pitch.
      E.g.
        c4~ 16

    Tuplets:
    --------
      Syntax:
        \tuplet fraction { music }
      Example: 3 quarter notes in the space of 2
        \tuplet 3/2 { b4 a g }

    Slurs:
    ------
      A slur is indicated by an open parenthesis ( starting immediately after
      the first note of the slur and ends with a closing parenthesis ) immediately
      following the last note of the slur.

  Rests:
  ------
    Rests function just like any other note name ('a' through 'g') but are
    represented by the letter 'r' and obviously do not have an associated
    octave or accidental.

  Time Signature:
  ---------------
    The time signature can be set with the \time command.  It has the following
    syntax:
      \time BEATS/DIV
    Where BEATS is the beats per measure and DIV is the duration that gets the
    beat.  Note that BEATS * DIV = one meaure, always.

    The \time command is placed within an input block and applies to all
    subsequent input.

  Key Signature:
  --------------
    The key signature is set with the \key command followed by a pitch (as above)
    and the optional keyword \major or \minor.
      \key aes \major
      \key f \minor     % should produce the same result as above

  Tempo Markings:
  ---------------
    A tempo marking can be indicated with either a string (e.g. "moderato") or
    a note duration in beats per minute (i.e. quarter note = 120). Both styles
    are indicated with a \tempo command.  E.g.
      \tempo "Andante"          % Andante tempo marking
      \tempo 4. = 96            % Dotted quarter note = 96 bpm
      \tempo "Presto" 4 = 120   % Presto (quarter note = 120 bpm)

    The \tempo command is placed within an input block and applies to all
    subsequent input.

  Clef:
  -----
    The clef is indicated by the \clef command which can have the following
    discrete values as arguments:
      "treble"
      "alto"
      "tenor"
      "bass"

  Staves:
  -------
    Changing Staves:
    ----------------
      A melody can jump between staves (most useful for piano music).
      E.g.: \change Staff = "down"  % Where "down" is the name of the staff to go to

      The \autochange command (preceding note input or \relative) will automatically switch
      between the two staves ONLY if they are named "up" and "down"
    

Layout:
-------
  Bar Lines:
  ----------
    Standard bar lines are inserted automatically each time the end of a
    measure is reached.  We can manually force bar lines or insert non-
    standard bar lines with the \bar command.

    Example bar lines:
      \bar ""         % An invisible bar line (allows a line break w/o a bar line)
      \bar "|"        % A normal single bar line
      \bar "."        % A thick (bold) single bar line
      \bar "||"       & A double bar
      \bar ".|"       % A double bar with first bar bold (thick)
      \bar ".."       % A double bar, both bold (thick)
      \bar "|.|"      % A triple bar, middle one bold (thick)
      \bar "|."       % A closing bar (end of piece). A double bar with second bar thick
      \bar ";"        % A dotted bar line
      \bar "!"        % A dashed bar line

    Note, when determining the placement of line breaks, lilypond attempts to
    always break at a bar line.  The purpose of the invisible bar line is to
    provide a potential line break position in the middle of a bar.

  Repeats:
  --------
    
    We can also manually insert various repeat symbols as bar lines, but they
    will not be recognized by lilypond as a repeated section.

    Example repeat symbols:
      \bar ".|:"      % Beginning repeat symbol
      \bar ":|."      % End repeat symbol
      \bar ":..:"     % End and begin new repeat symbol (double bold)
      \bar ":|.|:"    % End and begin new repeat symbol (double with center bold)
      \bar ":|.:"     % See 'repeats.ly'
      \bar ":.|.:"    % See 'repeats.ly'
      \bar "[|:"      % See 'repeats.ly'
      \bar ":|][|:"   % See 'repeats.ly'
      \bar ":|]"      % See 'repeats.ly'

Polyphony:
----------
  Chords:
  -------
    To represent chords, simply replace the single note pitch with a collection of
    pitches within angle brackets <>.
    CMaj = <c e g>
    Bb7 dotted half note = <bes' f d aes>

    Pitches within a \relative block are based on the first note of the preceding
    chord.

    The previous chord can be repeated with the shorthand symbol 'q' (even if other
    non-chord note have happened since the last chord.

  Simultaneous Expressions:
  -------------------------
    Any expressions (i.e. a \relative block) contained in double angle braces {}
    are considered simultaneous.  This generates an identical result as the 'chord'
    method described above (in single angle brackets <>), but each voice is written
    as its own 'melody', which can be more intuitive in certain contexts (i.e. a
    chorale).

    Note that if two expressions with different rhythms are combined in a
    simultaneous block (<<>>), it implicitly generates two staves.  Otherwise,
    both expressions are combined onto one staff.

  Explicit Independent Voices:
  ----------------------------
    To include two voices with different rhythms on one staaff, you must explicitly
    declare multiple voices with the following syntax:
      \new Staff  <<
        \new Voice = "voice name"
          \relative { \voiceOne % ... insert melody for first voice
            }
        \new Voice = "other voice name"
          \relative { \voiceTwo % ... the second voice's melody 
            }
      >>

    The Double-Slash Syntax:
    ------------------------
      A shorter syntax for explicit independent voices is the double-slash (\\)
      syntax.  It automatically assigns expressions in order they appear to
      voices \voiceOne, \voiceTwo, \voiceThree, and \voiceFour and their
      respective formatting rules.

      <<
        \relative { ... }   % gets assigned to voiceOne
        \\
        \relative { ... }   % gets assigned to voiceTwo
        \\
        \relative { ... }   % gets assigned to voiceThree
      >>

    Voice Ordering:
    ---------------
      voiceOne    = Highest voice
      voiceTwo    = Lowest voice
      voiceThree  = Second-highest
      voiceFour   = Second-lowest
      voiceFive   = Third-highest   % Note, there's no \voiceFive apparently
      voiceSix    = Third-lowest    % Also no \voiceSix command

Annotation:
-----------
  Simple annotation above the staff:
    ^"This text goes above the previous note"

File Structure:
---------------
\book {                 % Topmost structure - each \book generates its own output file
  \score {              % A set of scores is combined into a book; each can be, i.e. a movement
    \new Staff {        % 
      \new Voice {
        { c'4 d' e'2 }
      }
    }
    \layout { }
  }
  \paper { }
  \header { }
}

Titles and Headers:
-------------------
  \book
  -----
    Each \book block within a single file produces a separate output file.
    A \book can optionally be divided into separate \bookpart sections, each with its own
    formatting rules.

  \header
  -------
    \header {
        % The following fields are centered
      dedication = "Dedication"
      title = "Title"
      subtitle = "Subtitle"
      subsubtitle = "Subsubtitle"
        % The following fields are evenly spread on one line
        % the field "instrument" also appears on following pages
      instrument = \markup \with-color #green "Instrument"
      poet = "Poet"
      composer = "Composer"
        % The following fields are placed at opposite ends of the same line
      meter = "Meter"
      arranger = "Arranger"
        % The following fields are centered at the bottom
      tagline = "The tagline goes at the bottom of the last page"
      copyright = "The copyright goes at the bottom of the first page"
    }

Variables:
----------
  Variables can be defined and later re-expanded.
  Define: foo = { c4 d e d }
  Expand: \foo
