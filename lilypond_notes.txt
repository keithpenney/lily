GNU Lilypond music notation syntax and notes

General:
--------
  Case-sensitive
  Parser looks for whitespace-separation
  % single line comments
  %{ block (multi-line)comments %}
  All lilypond input files should have a \version statement

Version Statement:
------------------
  \version "2.20.0"

Basic Input:
------------
  Example:
  --------
    \version "2.20.0"
    {
      c' e' g' e'
    }

  Pitch:
  ------
    Note names are lowercase
    Octaves are specified with appended apostrophe's.
    E.g.
      c,,     % (C1) C three octaves below middle C
      c,      % (C2) C two octaves below middle C
      c       % (C3) C below middle C
      c'      % (C4) Middle C
      a'      % (A4) A above middle C
      d''     % (D5) D above C above middle C
      c'''    % (C6) C two octaves above middle C

    Note names are always absolute (i.e. are not relative to the key
    signature).

    Accidentals:
    ------------
      The syntactical elements for flat and sharp derive from Dutch/German. To
      indicate a flatted note, append an 'es'.  To indicate a sharped note,
      append an 'is'.

      E.g.
        aes   % Ab below middle C
        cis'' % C# above middle C
        feses'''8 % Fbb two octaves above middle C, eighth note duration

  Relative Input:
  ---------------
    The octave for each note is chosen to be relative to the note prior (w/in
    the same octave (+/- half-octave) using the 'relative' block.

    \relative { 
      c' d e f g a b c
    }

    The first note of the relative block determines the starting note of the
    melody.  From that point, all subsequent notes are placed relative to the
    note prior.  To raise a note by an octave relative to that which would have
    otherwise been assumed, append an apostrophe (or multiple).  To lower a 
    note by an octave, append a comma (or multiple).

    \relative {
      c'' d c' d, c d c' d,
    }
    
    In the above example, the melody starts on C above Middle C then goes up by
    a whole step, then up by a minor seventh, then down by a minor seventh, then
    repeats.

  Rhythm & Durations:
  -------------------
    The duration of a note is indicated by a number following the note name.
      Number  Note Duration
      ------  -------------
      1       Whole Note
      2       Half Note
      4       Quarter Note
      8       Eighth note
      16      Sixteenth Note
      32      Thirty-second Note

    If a note duration is not specified, the duration is taken from that of the
    previous note.

    Dotted Notes:
    -------------
      A dotted note is specified by an appended period '.' following the note
      name.  IMPORTANT! The note duration MUST be specified for a dotted note
      (i.e. the duration will not be assumed to be that of the prior note)

  Rests:
  ------
    Rests function just like any other note name ('a' through 'g') but are
    represented by the letter 'r' and obviously do not have an associated
    octave or accidental.

  Time Signature:
  ---------------
    The time signature can be set with the \time command.  It has the following
    syntax:
      \time BEATS/DIV
    Where BEATS is the beats per measure and DIV is the duration that gets the
    beat.  Note that BEATS * DIV = one meaure, always.

    The \time command is placed within an input block and applies to all
    subsequent input.

  Key Signature:
  --------------
    The key signature is set with the \key command followed by a pitch (as above)
    and the optional keyword \major or \minor.
      \key aes \major
      \key f \minor     % should produce the same result as above

  Tempo Markings:
  ---------------
    A tempo marking can be indicated with either a string (e.g. "moderato") or
    a note duration in beats per minute (i.e. quarter note = 120). Both styles
    are indicated with a \tempo command.  E.g.
      \tempo "Andante"          % Andante tempo marking
      \tempo 4. = 96            % Dotted quarter note = 96 bpm
      \tempo "Presto" 4 = 120   % Presto (quarter note = 120 bpm)

    The \tempo command is placed within an input block and applies to all
    subsequent input.

  Clef:
  -----
    The clef is indicated by the \clef command which can have the following
    discrete values as arguments:
      "treble"
      "alto"
      "tenor"
      "bass"

Layout:
-------
  Bar Lines:
  ----------
    Standard bar lines are inserted automatically each time the end of a
    measure is reached.  We can manually force bar lines or insert non-
    standard bar lines with the \bar command.

    Example bar lines:
      \bar ""         % An invisible bar line (allows a line break w/o a bar line)
      \bar "|"        % A normal single bar line
      \bar "."        % A thick (bold) single bar line
      \bar "||"       & A double bar
      \bar ".|"       % A double bar with first bar bold (thick)
      \bar ".."       % A double bar, both bold (thick)
      \bar "|.|"      % A triple bar, middle one bold (thick)
      \bar "|."       % A closing bar (end of piece). A double bar with second bar thick
      \bar ";"        % A dotted bar line
      \bar "!"        % A dashed bar line

    Note, when determining the placement of line breaks, lilypond attempts to
    always break at a bar line.  The purpose of the invisible bar line is to
    provide a potential line break position in the middle of a bar.

  Repeats:
  --------
    
    We can also manually insert various repeat symbols as bar lines, but they
    will not be recognized by lilypond as a repeated section.

    Example repeat symbols:
      \bar ".|:"      % Beginning repeat symbol
      \bar ":|."      % End repeat symbol
      \bar ":..:"     % End and begin new repeat symbol (double bold)
      \bar ":|.|:"    % End and begin new repeat symbol (double with center bold)
      \bar ":|.:"     % See 'repeats.ly'
      \bar ":.|.:"    % See 'repeats.ly'
      \bar "[|:"      % See 'repeats.ly'
      \bar ":|][|:"   % See 'repeats.ly'
      \bar ":|]"      % See 'repeats.ly'
